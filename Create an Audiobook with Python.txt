Both the above libraries can be easily installed by using the pip command; pip install PyPDF2, pip install pyttsx3.
PyPDF2 allows manipulation of pdf in memory. This python library is capable of tasks such as:

extract information about the document, such as title, author, etc.
document division by page
merge documents per page
cropping pages
merge multiple pages into one page
encrypt and decrypt PDF files
and 
I will use this library to split the pdf file page by page, then read the text on each page, then send the text to the next step in the process to create an audiobook with Python.
The pyttsx3 library is capable of converting text to speech offline. The text that we read from a pdf is then fed as an input to the text-to-speech engine:
import PyPDF2
pdfReader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(open('file.pdf', 'rb'))
import pyttsx3
speaker = pyttsx3.init()
for page_num in range(pdfReader.numPages):
    text =  pdfReader.getPage(page_num).extractText()
    speaker.say(text)
    speaker.runAndWait()
speaker.stop()
engine.save_to_file(text, 'audio.mp3')
engine.runAndWait()
